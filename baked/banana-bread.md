# [The Best Vegan Banana Bread](https://www.connoisseurusveg.com/vegan-banana-bread/)

## Ingredients

- 3 medium over ripe bananas
- 1/3 C sugar
- 1/3 C brown sugar
- 1/3 C canola oil
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 C flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 C brown sugar (for topping)

## Directions

- Preheat the oven to 350
- Lightly oil a 9-inch loaf pan and arrange a strip of parchment paper width-wise along the center, with just a bit hanging out over each side.
- Peel the bananas and place them into a large mixing bowl. Mash them well with a fork or potato masher.
- Add sugar, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla to the bowl. Stir until well-mixed.
- Add the flour to the bowl, then sprinkle the baking soda, cinnamon and salt on top of the flour.
- Stir everything together just until mixed. Don't overmix. The batter will be thick.
- Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top with the back of a spoon.
- Sprinkle the top with brown sugar.
- Bake for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
- Remove the pan from the oven and transfer it to a cooling rack. Allow the loaf to cool for at least 15 minutes before removing it from the pan.
- Slice and serve.
