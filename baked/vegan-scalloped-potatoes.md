## notes

- If doubling use a 9x13 baking dish & use a little less than 2C of veggie broth

## ingredients

- 2lb potatoes
- 3 Tbsp vegan butter
- 1/2 yellow onion
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 5 cloves garlic
- 3 Tbsp flour
- 1C vegetable broth
- 1C almond milk
- 1/4C nutritional yeast
- 1C vegan shredded cheese

## directions

- Preheat your oven to 400°F/200°C. Butter an 8×8 container and set aside. If you’re doubling this recipe, use a 9×13 pan.
- Using a mandolin or a very sharp knife, slice all of your potatoes into thin round slices. Set aside and cover with a damp paper towel or kitchen cloth.
- In a pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add in the onions, black pepper and sea salt. Saute for 5 minutes until the onions are translucent. Add in garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.
- Sprinkle the flour over the mixture, stirring together until the flour is fully incorporated and smooth, cooking for about 1 minute.
- Reduce heat to medium low and while whisking/stirring frequently, pour in the milk. Do the same for nutritional yeast, and then the veggie broth, stirring to ensure nothing clumps. Stir until you see the nutritional yeast fully dissolved/ incorporated, about 1-2 minutes. Let the sauce cook for another 2 minutes until everything is smooth and incorporated. Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
- In your 8×8 container, arrange half of your potatoes onto the pan. Pour over half of the sauce, and using a spatula, spoon or fork, just move around the pieces a bit to ensure that all of the potatoes are covered in the sauce. Top with ½ cup of vegan cheese (optional).
- Add on the rest of the potatoes on top, then top with the remaining cheese sauce, and the remaining vegan shredded cheddar cheese. Feel free to add more cheese!
- Cover the top of the scalloped potatoes with foil. Bake the dish for 45 minutes, then remove the cover and bake for 15 minutes, with the foil cover removed. Feel free to also broil the cheese for a few minutes until bubbly.
- Let the mix cool slightly, then slice into your scalloped potatoes. I make 9 slices. Garnish with parsley. Serve, and enjoy!
