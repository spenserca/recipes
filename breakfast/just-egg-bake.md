# just egg bake

## ingredients

- 1 T olive oil
- 1/2 onion diced
- 1 red pepper diced
- 8 oz mushrooms
- 14 oz veggie sausage
- 2 C baby greens
- 8 oz crescent roll dough
- 24 oz just egg
- 1/4 C plant-based milk
- 1C vegan shredded cheese
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp pepper
- 1/8 tsp garlic powder
- 1/8 tsp paprika
- 1/8 tsp black salt

## directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F and grease a large dish (9x13) with nonstick spray, oil, or butter. Cut all of the veggies into bite-sized pieces.
2.  Bring a large skillet to medium-high heat. Add the olive oil to it and sauté the onions, peppers, and mushrooms until they start to soften (about 5-6 minutes). Add the sausage to the pan and cook it for 1-2 minutes. Stir in the greens and take the pan off the heat once they have wilted.
3.  Roll the crescent roll dough out onto the bottom of the dish. Press to seal any holes in the dough. Place the sausage/veggie mixture on top of the crescent dough. Sprinkle most of the cheese above that layer.
4.  In a large bowl, whisk the Just Egg, plant milk, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika together. Pour the egg mixture all over the casserole layers. Spread the remaining cheese over the egg mixture.
5.  Bake the casserole in the oven for 40-50 minutes. Cover the dish if it looks like it might burn toward the end of the cooking time. Take it out when the top is starting to brown and the middle stays firm when you give the dish a little shake. Dust it with a fine layer of black salt and then let it cool for at least 10 minutes.
