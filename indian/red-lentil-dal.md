# Instant Pot Brown Basmati Rice

**Ingredients**
_____
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (or ghee)
- 1 onion (chopped)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 tablespoons ginger (minced)
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 cups stock
- 1 1/2 cups red lentils
- 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (including juices)


**Directions**
_____
1. Heat oil in a medium sized pot over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook for 5-7 minutes, until soft.
2. Make a space in the onion and add the minced garlic and ginger. Add a bit of extra oil if needed. Cook for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.
3. Add all the spices: curry powder, cumin, coriander, garam masala, turmeric and salt. Stir to coat onions and cook for 1-2 minutes, until spices are fragrant. Be careful not to burn: stir occasionally and keep an eye on them.
4. Add around 1 cup of stock, and use a spatula to scrape all the bits off the bottom of the pan.
5. Add the rest of the stock, the lentils and diced tomatoes. Stir, cover, bring to a simmer, then cook (covered), for 30 minutes. You will want to stir occasionally to prevent anything from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
6. Serve with rice and naan bread.
